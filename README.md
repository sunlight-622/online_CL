# Online Continual Learning  Datasets Repository
#The project page will be available

# Overview
This repository provides a standardized and reproducible implementation of popular benchmark datasets for Continual Learning (CL) scenarios. It aims to streamline the data preprocessing pipeline, ensuring that experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and others are consistent with the state-of-the-art literature.

We provide ready-to-use data loaders that handle task partitioning, data streaming, and format transformation (e.g., channel adjustments) out of the box.
